# Project #2: Building Your First Full-Stack Application

## Technical Requirements

For this project, you will be making a full CRUD app using the technologies outlined below. When thinking of an app idea, try to frame the project in terms of trying to solve a "problem" and think about the purpose of the app, who would use it, etc. The problem doesn't have to be anything intense and can be something small and simple! For example:

> **Problem:** I have a huge mechanical keyboard collection and want to organize it all in one place
> **General App Idea/Purpose:** An app that allows me to catalogue all my mechanical keyboards by category
> **Who Would Use It:** Mechanical keyboard dorks like me

### &#x1F534; Mandatory to pass:

#### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- A working full-stack application, built by you, using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and EJS**.
- Adhere to the **MVC** file structure: Models, Views, Controllers.
- At least one model with all 7 **RESTful routes** and full **CRUD**.
- Use EJS Partials.
- A public repository on GitHub.
- Small, frequent commits.
- **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public via **Heroku**.
- **A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc.
- Have a **link to your hosted working app** in the **`README.md`** file in your GitHub repo.

### &#x1F535; Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory):

#### Recommended Features

- Include **sign up/log in** functionality with encrypted passwords
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap
- Include portfolio-quality styling
- Inside Your `README.md`:
  - Include **wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
- Add additional relationships (models can be related in a one-to-many relationship, for example)

  - https://www.bezkoder.com/mongoose-one-to-many-relationship/

## Make A New Repo & Setup for Heroku Deployment

To prepare for the Heroku deployment lesson during project week, please make sure you create a new github repo for your project and have a basic express server running.

To see how to get set up for heroku deployment, take a look at [these notes (up to the "Sign up for MongoDB Atlas" section)](/express/bonus/heroku.md).

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **REMEMBER:** For all projects, you will be creating the new repos on [GitHub](https://github.com/), **not** GitHub Enterprise!

## Technical Demonstration

All projects will be presented to the class. Your presentation should be:

- **Approximately 5-10 minutes in length**
- Shows off all features of the app
- Explains the technical details
- Explains the technical challenges
- Explains which improvements you might make
- Talk about one new thing you learned during this project (can be something technical, or even something more non-technical like time management, etc.)

You will be sharing your app and your code. Be prepared to answer questions from the instructors and other students.

## How to Submit Your Project

Your project is due on Friday, July 15. You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

## Where to go for help during project week

1. Seek out help online
2. Seek out help with your classmates
3. Seek out help with your instructors

## Etc.

<details><summary><strong>Suggested Ways to Get Started</strong></summary>
* **Wireframe** Make a drawing of what your app will look like in all of the stages of the app(what does it look like as soon as you log on to the site? What does it look like while the player is playing? What does it look like when the player wins / loses?).

- **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually.

- **Commit early, commit often.** Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Think about...</strong></summary>

- **Creativity**
  Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

- **Code Quality**
  Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indentation, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you add good comments to your code?

- **Problem Solving**
Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
